## HTML and CSS

I have wanted a website for a while because I wanted to have a unique place on the internet were I could write. So I decided to learn HTML and CSS to make a simple static website. A couple of months prior I tried learning HTML and CSS and failed because I couldn't remember everything and I was overwhelmed, so this time I didn't try to memorize everything and just focused on memorizing the nessasary syntax. This time I could right basic HTML and CSS in a day and make a simple web page. Sure it was basic but it was all I really needed I did not plan to heavly use CSS on my website I wanted it to be simplistic.

## Learning a Framework

From the start I did not want to use a large framework, I wanted somthing fast and simple. I decided on a light and fast frame work called Hugo, which had everything I was looking for in a framwork. Instead of writing a load of syntax I could write things in Markdown making the process of making posts less tedious. I read the documention and watched some guides online on how to set up a quick hugo site. After a little while I was able to make fast static websites with the Hugo framework. 

## Making This Website and Hosting It

With this new skill of making quick small sites I was able to put together this site fairly quickly and write this post. I heard of a service called Netlify were you can import a repository from a service like github or gitlab, then host it on there servers. There is many ways to use Netlify but I chose the easy way that did not require me to add any Netlify files to my repository. After a little bit of clicking I made this website.
